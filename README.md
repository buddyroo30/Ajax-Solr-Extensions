# Ajax-Solr-Extensions
Extensions to the Ajax-Solr JavaScript framework for creating search user interfaces to Apache Solr.

[AJAX Solr](https://github.com/evolvingweb/ajax-solr) is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces to the popular [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) search engine. I have successfully used Ajax-Solr to create several internal web interfaces to Solr at my company [Bristol-Myers Squibb](http://www.bms.com). As part of this I created some extensions and enhancements to Ajax-Solr that I feel would be valuable to other Ajax-Solr users and thus I am releasing those here. Specifically, I created 2 new widgets for viewing and querying facets:

* **MultiSelectWidget.js** This is a useful alternative to Ajax-Solr's TagcloudWidget.js. Whereas TagcloudWidget.js shows facet values as a tag cloud and users can select a single facet value (and only a single facet value) by clicking on it, MultiSelectWidget.js shows the facet values in a list ordered by count with checkboxes that the user can check to choose facet values (and more than one facet value for a facet can be selected, resulting in an "OR" query for the selected values). It also supports binned ranges for numerical values (e.g. "0 TO 24", "25 TO 49", etc.), allowing sorting of the facet values based on the ranges instead of the counts (which can be more intuitive).
* **RangeWidget.js** For numerical fields, this widget allows users to add a range query (e.g. "23 TO 57", etc.) on the field to the overall Solr query by either moving 2 sliders on superimposed [HTML 5 range input elements](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_range.asp), or by directly entering (into input text boxes) the left and right range values.
